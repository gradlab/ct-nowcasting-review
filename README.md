For any questions please contact [Tse Yang Lim](mailto:tseyanglim@hsph.harvard.edu)

## Test status
This code has been tested on two machines, running Windows 10 and Windows 11. Code was developed using R version 4.3.0, and has also been run using R version 4.2.0. No non-standard hardware is required. Typical install time should be 10-15 minutes, including reading instructions, assuming R is already installed and appropriately configured.

Further instructions are in the [code](code) subdirectory and its [Readme](code/README.md). Overall run time is on the order of 15-30 minutes for most analyses, but longer (a few hours) for the sample size analysis (`6_sample_size_analysis.R`). Expected outputs are the figures and tables in the [figures](figures) and [outputs](outputs) subdirectories here.
